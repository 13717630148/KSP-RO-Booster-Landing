# KSP-RO-Booster-Landing
A booster landing script using kOS mod for Kerbal Space Program

Please see the wiki page for installation guide: https://github.com/Patrykz94/KSP-RO-Booster-Landing/wiki

This script contains a library called lib_navball.ks made by the KSLib team which can be found at: https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KSLib

I also use a modified version of MNV_TIME function to calculate how long the landing burn will take. It was originally created by Kevin Gisi and can be found at: https://github.com/gisikw/ksprogramming/blob/master/library/maneuver.ks
